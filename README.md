## Jekyll Starter

This starter uses webpack for react/es6

It also includes a Rakefile that runs multi threads
to run `bundle exec jekyll s -L` (which includes jekyll-livereload) and `webpack -w` at the same time.

### Setup

- `npm install -g webpack`
- `npm install`
- `bundle install`
- `rake start`
